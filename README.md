# About pyexception

Here is an implementation of an exception handling framework.
It is centered around the concepts explained in "Practical Exception Handling".

Please be aware that this is an experimental release and a proposal. Future versions may not be
compatible. Compatiblity issues may be avoided by using git hash codes.

What do you find novel about this library?

‚óè Looking at this pyexception library, several novel aspects stand out:

  *Structured Exception Information*: The info dictionary approach is
  interesting - exceptions carry structured data specifically designed for
  UI display and debugging, rather than just error messages.

  *Unified Recovery Pattern*: The RecoveredException base class creates a
  single handler interface for all recoverable exceptions regardless of
  their underlying cause, which simplifies error handling architecture.

  *Context-Aware Assertions*: The fatal_section() and nonfatal_section()
  context managers that dynamically change assertion behavior based on
  program state is clever - assertions can be more or less strict depending
   on whether side effects have occurred.

  *Thread-Local Configuration*: Using thread-local storage for assertion
  configuration allows different execution contexts to have different error
   handling behaviors simultaneously.

  *Reason-Based Exception Design*: The Reason class hierarchy separates the
  "what happened" from the "why it matters" - exceptions can have detailed
  reasons with metadata while maintaining clean handler interfaces.

  *Assertion-Exception Integration*: The tight coupling between assertions
  (expect(), imperative()) and the exception framework, where assertions
  can be configured to log, warn, or raise based on context rather than
  being binary pass/fail.
